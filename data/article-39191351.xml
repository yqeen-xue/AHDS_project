In this prospective study, we examined the associations between combined exposure to sexual and physical/emotional abuse during childhood with risk of post-COVID-19 conditions in adulthood. Additionally, we explored the extent to which lifestyle, health-related and psychological factors explain this association.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We used data from three large, ongoing cohorts: Nurses' Health Study (NHS)-II, NHS3, and the Growing Up Today Study. Between April 2020 and November 2021, participants responded to periodic COVID-19 surveys. Participants were included if they responded to a questionnaire about childhood abuse, subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and responded to questions about post-COVID-19 conditions. Childhood sexual abuse was measured before the COVID-19 pandemic with the Sexual Maltreatment Scale of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale, and physical/emotional abuse was measured with the Physical and Emotional Abuse Subscale of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Post-COVID-19 conditions, defined as COVID-19-related symptoms lasting 4&#xa0;weeks or longer (e.g., fatigue, dyspnea), were self-reported in the final COVID-19 questionnaire in November 2021. Sexual abuse and physical/emotional abuse were examined separately and jointly in relation to post-COVID-19 conditions. Data on key lifestyle (e.g., cigarette smoking), health-related (e.g., asthma, diabetes), and psychological factors (e.g., depression and anxiety) were obtained.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of 2851 participants, the mean age (range) was 55.8 (22.0-75.0) years; 2789 (97.8&#xa0;%) were females, and 2750 (96.5&#xa0;%) were whites. We observed a dose-dependent relationship between severity of childhood abuse and post-COVID conditions (p-trend:&lt;0.0001); participants with severe versus no childhood abuse had a 42&#xa0;% higher subsequent risk of post-COVID conditions [relative risk (95&#xa0;% confidence interval): 1.42 (1.25 to 1.61)]. Key lifestyle, health-related, and psychological factors mediated 25.5&#xa0;% of this association. Both sexual and physical/emotional abuse, were independently associated with post-COVID conditions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In this prospective study of 2851 participants, childhood abuse was significantly associated with increased risk of post-COVID conditions. Biological pathways connecting childhood abuse with subsequent risk of post-COVID conditions should be investigated.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Elsevier Inc.
