This study aims to examine the relationship between the long-term effects of COVID-19, levels of anxiety and depression, and suicidal ideation with sociodemographic factors and symptoms. A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients who came for control at least 3&#x2009;months after having COVID-19 disease, in the stable period, and still have symptoms after COVID-19. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, The Beck Depression Scale (BDS), The Beck Anxiety Scale (BAS), and suicidal ideation were assessed with face-to-face questionnaires. A total of 490 patients participated in the study. Thirty percent of patients scored positive on the BDS and 46% scored high on the BAS. Female sex was found to be a risk factor. Anxiety and depression were found to be significantly associated with long COVID symptoms. Both BAS and BDS scores were significantly higher in people with suicidality compared to others, and long-term symptoms were found to be statistically associated with this situation. Depression and anxiety are common in cases of long COVID. It is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of these potential mental health consequences, especially suicidality, and to provide appropriate support and interventions for individuals with long COVID.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>&#xd6;z&#xe7;elik</LastName><ForeName>Neslihan</ForeName><Initials>N</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pulmonology, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Training and Research Hospital, Rize, Turkey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>&#xd6;zyurt</LastName><ForeName>Song&#xfc;l</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pulmonology, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Training and Research Hospital, Rize, Turkey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Topalo&#x11f;lu</LastName><ForeName>Elvan &#x15e;ent&#xfc;rk</ForeName><Initials>E&#x15e;</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pulmonology, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Training and Research Hospital, Rize, Turkey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>G&#xfc;m&#xfc;&#x15f;</LastName><ForeName>Aziz</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pulmonology, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Training and Research Hospital, Rize, Turkey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hocao&#x11f;lu</LastName><ForeName>&#xc7;i&#xe7;ek</ForeName><Initials>&#xc7;</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychiatry, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Training and Research Hospital, Rize, Turkey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>&#x15e;ahin</LastName><ForeName>&#xdc;nal</ForeName><Initials>&#xdc;</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pulmonology, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Training and Research Hospital, Rize, Turkey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>01</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>J Investig Med</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9501229</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1081-5589</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19 survivors</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">long COVID</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">neuropsychiatric sequelae</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">post-COVID syndrome</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">suicidal tendencies</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">suicidality</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">suicide</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>7</Hour><Minute>53</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">38869167</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/10815589241261291</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
