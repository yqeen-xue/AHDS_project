According to the study, long COVID, a syndrome characterized by chronic fatigue and muscle complaints beyond the initial phase, may be related with muscle atrophy or acute sarcopenia. Physical activity programs, according to the researchers, could help reverse the underlying muscle atrophy and ease weariness in long COVID patients. According to published studies, physically active patients with long COVID have shorter duration and less intensity of symptoms. However, the study found that a tiny minority of people with long-COVID may not benefit from physical activity regimens. As a result, the authors conclude that more research with homogeneous samples is required to provide stronger conclusions about the scheduled physical activity in the management of long COVID. The absence of substantial research on the usefulness of physical activity programs in treating long COVID is the statement's weak aspect. While few published articles imply that physical activity can reduce the length and intensity of long COVID symptoms, there is also evidence that these programs do not assist all patients. This suggests that more research on homogeneous populations is needed to provide conclusive response on usefulness of planned physical exercise in long COVID management. The following elements may affect the findings and make it more challenging to reach firm conclusions. A medical condition requires specific treatment for long COVID. In addition to the broad issues discussed, there are significant issues that should be recognized. i. While a positive COVID test may support a patient's clinical diagnosis, there is the possibility of undiagnosed comorbid diseases. Additionally, the patient may suffer from a second COVID-19 infection. ii. All prior vaccinations must be covered by the most current dose. iii. There must be enough information to establish how the disease influences health problems.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="received"><Year>2023</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>5</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="accepted"><Year>2023</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>6</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2023</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>21</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2023</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>21</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2023</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>21</Day><Hour>3</Hour><Minute>52</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pmc-release"><Year>2023</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>29</Day></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>epublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">37731386</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pmc">PMC10583139</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.4081/ejtm.2023.11722</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><ReferenceList><Reference><Citation>Coscia F, Di Filippo ES, Gigliotti PV, Fano Illic G.
