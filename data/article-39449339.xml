These patients are more likely to suffer from multiple organ failure, readmission, and mortality. According to a recent theory, long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms may be caused by abnormal autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, such as hypovolemia, brain stem involvement, and autoimmune reactions. Furthermore, COVID-19 can also cause impaired fertility in women, which may also be related to inflammation and immune responses. Currently, few treatments are available for long-COVID symptoms. This article reviews the major effects of COVID-19 on the nervous system and female fertility, as well as offers potential treatment approaches.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright&#xa9; Bentham Science Publishers;
