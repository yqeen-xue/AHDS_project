Up to half of COVID-19 patients experience kidney complications, with those facing acute respiratory failure and kidney injury having the worst overall prognosis. Despite the significant impact of CAKI on COVID-19-related mortality and its enduring effects in long COVID, the underlying causes and molecular mechanisms of CAKI remain elusive. In this study, we identified a functional relationship between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein and inflammation-driven apoptotic death of renal tubular epithelial cells in patients with CAKI. We demonstrate <i>in vitro</i> that ORF3a independently induces renal cell-specific apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by the elevation of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and the activation of NF-kB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine (TNF&#x3b1; and IL-6) production. By examining kidney tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-ACE2 transgenic mice, we observed a similar correlation between ORF3a-induced cytopathic changes and kidney injury. This correlation was further validated through reconstitution of the ORF3a effects via direct adenoviral injection into mouse kidneys. Through medicinal analysis, we identified a natural compound, glycyrrhizin (GL4419), which not only blocks viral replication in renal cells, but also mitigates ORF3a-induced renal cell death by inhibiting activation of a high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, leading to a reduction of KIM-1. Moreover, ORF3a interacts with HMGB1. Overproduction or downregulation of <i>hmgb1</i> expression results in correlative changes in renal cellular KIM-1 response and respective cytokine production, implicating a crucial role of HMGB1 in ORF3a-inflicted kidney injuries. Our data suggest a direct functional link between ORF3a and kidney injury, highlighting ORF3a as a unique therapeutic target contributing to CAKI.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="IMPORTANCE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The major challenge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the pandemic is COVID-19-related mortality, which has tragically claimed millions of lives. COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality are often exacerbated by pre-existing medical conditions, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), or the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to COVID-19, collectively known as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Patients who experience acute respiratory failure with CAKI have the poorest clinical outcomes, including increased mortality. Despite these alarming clinical findings, there is a critical gap in our understanding of the underlying causes of CAKI. Our study establishes a direct correlation between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral ORF3a protein and kidney injury induced by ORF3a linking to CAKI. This functional relationship was initially observed in our clinical studies of COVID-19 patients with AKI and was further validated through animal and <i>in vitro</i> cellular studies, either by expressing ORF3a alone or in the context of viral infection. By elucidating this functional relationship and its underlying mechanistic pathways, our research deepens the understanding of COVID-19-associated kidney diseases and presents potential therapeutic avenues to address the healthcare challenges faced by individuals with underlying conditions.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author
