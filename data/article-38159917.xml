A systematic review and meta-analyses published in 2022, which mainly focus on the Western population, revealed that the prevalence of long COVID was 25.24%. Literature regarding long-COVID in children in Asia was scarce. The objectives of our study were to assess the long-term effect of COVID-19 infection in children and its correlation to their acute COVID- 19 infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This study was conducted in Hospital Kepala Batas (HKB), a district hospital in Penang State, Malaysia, which was the designated regional COVID hospital during the pandemic. It was a retrospective observational study, where children who were admitted from November 2020 to March 2021, and attended follow-up clinics from Jan 2021 to May 2021, were recruited.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">This study comprised 90 subjects, from 3 months old to 12 years old, mean of 6.5 years old. When comparing asymptomatic and symptomatic children, children with comorbidities were more likely to be symptomatic with a pvalue of 0.045 using the Pearson Chi-square test. All our patients' symptoms resolved upon discharge. During followup at 2-4 months after COVID-19 infection, all children were reported as back to their usual selves. Fifteen patients had recurrent symptoms. Most of their symptoms pointed towards an acute infection. One patient had two episodes of illness, while the rest had one. The most common symptoms were cough, fever and runny nose. The average duration of illness of these 16 episodes was 4.5 days with a standard deviation of 2.48. None of these symptoms lasted more than seven days. None of them required hospital admission. None of them had recurrent COVID-19 infections. Tweleve out of 72 children who had been going to school stopped physical school after COVID-19 infection. Our findings differed from other studies. These could be due to the limitations that we faced.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Most children who contracted COVID-19 infection recovered fully after acute infection, and most of them recovered fully without long-term sequelae.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tan</LastName><ForeName>M S</ForeName><Initials>MS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hospital Kepala Batas, Paediatric Department, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. tanmeisee@yahoo.com.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zulkifli</LastName><ForeName>N A</ForeName><Initials>NA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hospital Kepala Batas, Paediatric Department, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Teng</LastName><ForeName>W</ForeName><Initials>W</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hospital Kepala Batas, Paediatric Department, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lim</LastName><ForeName>P T</ForeName><Initials>PT</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hospital Seberang Jaya, Clinic Research Unit, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D064888">Observational Study</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>Malaysia</Country><MedlineTA>Med J Malaysia</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>0361547</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0300-5283</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><MeshHeadingList><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D002648" MajorTopicYN="N">Child</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D006801" MajorTopicYN="N">Humans</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D007223" MajorTopicYN="N">Infant</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D000086382" MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</DescriptorName><QualifierName UI="Q000453" MajorTopicYN="N">epidemiology</QualifierName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D008296" MajorTopicYN="N" Type="Geographic">Malaysia</DescriptorName><QualifierName UI="Q000453" MajorTopicYN="N">epidemiology</QualifierName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D058873" MajorTopicYN="N">Pandemics</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D000094024" MajorTopicYN="Y">Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome</DescriptorName><QualifierName UI="Q000453" MajorTopicYN="N">epidemiology</QualifierName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D000086402" MajorTopicYN="N">SARS-CoV-2</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D012189" MajorTopicYN="N">Retrospective Studies</DescriptorName></MeshHeading></MeshHeadingList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>1</Month><Day>3</Day><Hour>9</Hour><Minute>44</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>1</Month><Day>2</Day><Hour>11</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2023</Year><Month>12</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>19</Hour><Minute>22</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">38159917</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
