After proven-effective treatments for acute COVID-19 were established by evidence-based guidelines, little remains known about home oxygen requirements following hospitalization for COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS">This was a retrospective, multi-center cohort study of subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 between October 2020-September 2021 at 3 academic health centers. Information was abstracted from electronic health records at the index hospitalization and for 60 d after discharge. The World Health Organization COVID-19 Clinical Progression Scale score was used to identify patients with severe COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Of 517 subjects (mean age 58 y, 47% female, 42% Black, 36% Hispanic, 22% with severe COVID-19), 81% were treated with systemic corticosteroids, 61% with remdesivir, and 2.5% with tocilizumab. About one quarter of subjects were discharged on home oxygen (26% [95% CI 22-29]). Older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.02 per 5 y [95% CI 1.02-1.02]), higher body mass index (aOR 1.02 per kg/m<sup>2</sup> [1.00-1.04]), diabetes (yes vs no, aOR 1.73 [1.46-2.02]), severe COVID-19 (vs moderate, aOR 3.19 [2.19-4.64]), and treatment with systemic corticosteroids (yes vs no, aOR 30.63 [4.51-208.17]) were associated with an increased odds of discharge on home oxygen. Comorbid hypertension (yes vs no, aOR 0.71 [0.66-0.77) was associated with a decreased odds of home oxygen. Within 60 d of hospital discharge, 50% had documentation of pulse oximetry; in this group, home oxygen was discontinued in 46%.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">About one in 4 subjects were prescribed home oxygen after hospitalization for COVID-19, even after guidelines established proven-effective treatments for acute illness. Evidence-based strategies to reduce the requirement for home oxygen in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are needed.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 by Daedalus Enterprises.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Freedman</LastName><ForeName>Michael B</ForeName><Initials>MB</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Drs Freedman and Kaul are affiliated with Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep, and Allergy, Department of Medicine, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; and Medical Service, Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.
