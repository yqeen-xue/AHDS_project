COVID-19 had caused more than 1.1 million deaths in the U.S. as of May 2023 and contributed to a 3-year decline in life expectancy. A coalition of public health workers and community activists launched an external review of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's pandemic management from January 2021 to May 2023. The authors used a modified Delphi process to identify core pandemic management areas, which formed the basis for a survey and literature review. Their analysis yields 3 overarching shortcomings of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's pandemic management: (1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leadership downplays the serious impacts and aerosol transmission risks of COVID-19, (2) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leadership has aligned public guidance with commercial and political interests over scientific evidence, and (3) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance focuses on individual choice rather than emphasizing prevention and equity. Instead, the agency must partner with communities most impacted by the pandemic and encourage people to protect one another using layered protections to decrease COVID-19 transmission. Because emerging variants can already evade existing vaccines and treatments and Long COVID can be disabling and lacks definitive treatment, multifaceted, sustainable approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic are essential to protect people, the economy, and future generations.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; 2024 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jirmanus</LastName><ForeName>Lara Z</ForeName><Initials>LZ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>People's CDC, Boston, Massachusetts.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Valenti</LastName><ForeName>Rita M</ForeName><Initials>RM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>People's CDC, Boston, Massachusetts.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Griest Schwartzman</LastName><ForeName>Eiryn A</ForeName><Initials>EA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>COVID Safe Campus, Baltimore, Maryland.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Simon-Ortiz</LastName><ForeName>Sophia A</ForeName><Initials>SA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>People's CDC, Boston, Massachusetts.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Frey</LastName><ForeName>Lauren I</ForeName><Initials>LI</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>People's CDC, Boston, Massachusetts.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Friedman</LastName><ForeName>Samuel R</ForeName><Initials>SR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>People's CDC, Boston, Massachusetts.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Drug Use and HIV/HCV Research, NYU Grossman School of Public Health, New York, New York.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Fullilove</LastName><ForeName>Mindy T</ForeName><Initials>MT</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>People's CDC, Boston, Massachusetts.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>The New School, New York, New York.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>02</Month><Day>25</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>AJPM Focus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9918487585606676</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2773-0654</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">ethics</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">health equity</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">nonpharmaceutical interventions</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">population health</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>21</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>44</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>21</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>21</Day><Hour>3</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pmc-release"><Year>2024</Year><Month>2</Month><Day>25</Day></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>epublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">38770235</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pmc">PMC11103433</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1016/j.focus.2024.100207</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">S2773-0654(24)00026-9</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><ReferenceList><Reference><Citation>Sch&#xf6;ley J, Aburto JM, Kashnitsky I, et al.
