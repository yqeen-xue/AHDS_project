Although various risk factors for COVID-19 sequelae have been identified, little is known about whether a sedentary lifestyle is an independent risk factor.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this retrospective cohort study, 4850 participants self-reported their COVID-19 sequelae symptoms between June and August 2022. A sedentary lifestyle included physical inactivity (&lt;150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity) and prolonged sedentary behavior (&#x2265;10 h/day) before the fifth COVID-19 wave was recorded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationships between sedentary lifestyle and risk of acute and post-acute (lasting &#x2265;2 months) COVID-19 sequelae.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 1443 COVID-19 survivors and 2962 non-COVID-19 controls were included. Of the COVID-19 survivors, &gt;80% and &gt;40% self-reported acute and post-acute COVID-19 sequelae, respectively. In the post-acute phase, COVID-19 survivors who were physically inactive had a 37% lower risk of insomnia, whereas those with prolonged sedentary behavior had 25%, 67%, and 117% higher risks of at least one symptom, dizziness, and "pins and needles" sensation, respectively. For the acute phase, prolonged sedentary behavior was associated with a higher risk of fatigue, "brain fog," dyspnea, muscle pain, joint pain, dizziness, and "pins and needles" sensation. Notably, sedentary behavior, rather than physical inactivity, was correlated with a higher risk of severe post-COVID-19 sequelae in both acute and post-acute phases.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Prolonged sedentary behavior was independently associated with a higher risk of both acute and post-acute COVID-19 sequelae, whereas physical inactivity played contradictory roles in COVID-19 sequelae.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Elsevier Inc.
