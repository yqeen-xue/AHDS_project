However, the current prevalence of previous COVID-19 infection in university students, including symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, is unknown. Our goal therefore was to determine the prevalence of previous infection, risk factors for infection, and the prevalence of persistent symptoms following infection among university students.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS">This was a cross-sectional study set in a large public university between January 22 and March 22, 2021. We surveyed students about demographics, risk factors, and symptoms, and simultaneously tested their saliva for IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. To estimate the prevalence of previous infection we adjusted our intentional sample of a diverse student population for year in school and age to resemble the composition of the entire student body and adjusted for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test. Univariate and multiple regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for infection, and the proportion of students with persistent symptoms following acute infection was determined.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS">A total of 488 students completed the survey, 432 had a valid antibody result, and 428 had both. The estimated prevalence of previous infection for 432 participants with valid antibody results was 41%. Of 145 students in our sample with a positive antibody test, 41.4% denied having a previous positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 and presumably had an asymptomatic infection; in our adjusted analysis we estimate that approximately 2-thirds of students had asymptomatic infections. Independent risk factors for infection included male sex, having a roommate with a known symptomatic infection, and having two or fewer roommates. More frequent attendance of parties and bars was a univariate risk factor, but not in the multiple regression analysis. Of 122 students reporting a previous symptomatic infection, 14 (11.4%) reported persistent symptoms consistent with postacute COVID-19 a median of 132 days later.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE">Previous COVID-19 infection, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, was common at a large university. Measures that could prevent resurgence of the infection when students return to campus include mandatory vaccination policies, mass surveillance testing, and testing of sewage for antigen to SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9;
