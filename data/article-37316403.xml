These patients are often less responsive to traditional speech-language pathology treatments and there is emerging literature that suggests dysfunctional breathing (DB) might contribute to dyspnea and other symptoms in this patient population. Treatment of DB through breathing retraining has been shown to improve breathing and successfully reduce symptoms similar to those seen in patients with long COVID. There is some preliminary evidence that breathing retraining is helpful for patients with post COVID condition symptoms. However, breathing retraining protocols tend to be heterogeneous and are often not systematic or well described.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This case series reports on an Integrative Breathing Therapy (IBT) protocol used in patients diagnosed with post COVID condition symptoms attending an otolaryngology clinic who presented with signs and symptoms of DB. A systematic evaluation of the biomechanical, biochemical, and psychophysiological dimensions of DB based on principles of IBT was performed on each patient to enable targeted patient-centered care. Patients were then provided with intensive breathing retraining that aimed to comprehensively improve breathing functionality in all these three dimensions of breathing. Treatment involved 6-12 sessions of weekly 1-hour group telehealth sessions combined with 2-4 individual sessions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">All participants showed improvements in the parameters of DB measured and also reported a reduction in symptoms and improved daily function.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">These findings suggest that patients with long COVID who present with signs and symptoms of DB might respond positively to comprehensive and intensive breathing retraining that addresses biochemical, biomechanical, and psychophysiological dimensions of breathing. More research is required to further refine this protocol and confirm its effectiveness through a controlled trial.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 The Voice Foundation.
