Primary care providers (PCPs) will often be the first point of contact for patients experiencing potential complications of post-COVID symptoms. The aim of this article is to present a post-COVID management tool for PCPs to use as a quick reference and guide to the initial workup and management of the most common post-COVID symptoms.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS">Published guidance, recent literature, and expert specialist opinion were used to create the structure outlining the outpatient evaluation and treatment for post-COVID symptoms.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS">A quick-reference guide for management of post-COVID symptoms was created for PCPs. Educational materials were created for clinicians to share with patients. Our article reviews several common complaints including respiratory, cognitive, and neurological symptoms, chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, and anosmia and presents recommendations for management.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">Data on long-term effects of COVID-19 are still emerging, and rapid dissemination of this data to front-line PCPs is crucial. This table was our effort to make the currently available evidence accessible for our PCPs in a simple, easy-to-use format.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; Copyright 2021 by the American Board of Family Medicine.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Vance</LastName><ForeName>Heather</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>From University Health Service, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (HV);
