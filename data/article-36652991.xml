Based on age (within 5 years) and sex, each case was randomly matched with up to 10 participants without COVID-19 infection from two cohorts-a contemporary cohort between 16 March 2020 and 30 November 2020 and a historical cohort between 16 March 2018 and 30 November 2018. The characteristics between groups were further adjusted with propensity score-based marginal mean weighting through stratification. To determine the association of COVID-19 with CVD and mortality within 21 days of diagnosis (acute phase) and after this period (post-acute phase), Cox regression was employed. In the acute phase, patients with COVID-19 (n = 7584) were associated with a significantly higher short-term risk of CVD {hazard ratio (HR): 4.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6- 6.9]; HR: 5.0 (95% CI: 3.0-8.1)} and all-cause mortality [HR: 81.1 (95% CI: 58.5-112.4); HR: 67.5 (95% CI: 49.9-91.1)] than the contemporary (n = 75 790) and historical controls (n = 75 774), respectively. Regarding the post-acute phase, patients with COVID-19 (n = 7139) persisted with a significantly higher risk of CVD in the long-term [HR: 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2-1.8); HR: 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1- 1.6)] and all-cause mortality [HR: 5.0 (95% CI: 4.3-5.8); HR: 4.5 (95% CI: 3.9-5.2) compared to the contemporary (n = 71 296) and historical controls (n = 71 314), respectively.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">COVID-19 infection, including long-COVID, is associated with increased short- and long-term risks of CVD and mortality. Ongoing monitoring of signs and symptoms of developing these cardiovascular complications post diagnosis and up till at least a year post recovery may benefit infected patients, especially those with severe disease.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; The Author(s) 2023.
