This study assessed whether symptoms associated with long COVID among patients referred for cardiovascular evaluation are associated with objective abnormalities on cardiac testing to explain their clinical presentation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A retrospective cohort study of 40,462 unique patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at our tertiary referral was conducted and identified 363 patients with persistent cardiovascular symptoms a minimum of 4 weeks after polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 infection. Patients had no cardiovascular symptoms prior to COVID-19 infection. Each patient was referred for cardiovascular evaluation at a tertiary referral center. The incidence and etiology of abnormalities on cardiovascular testing among patients with long COVID symptoms are reported here. The cohort was subsequently divided into 3 categories based on the dominant circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant at the time of initial infection for further analysis.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Among 40,462 unique patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at our tertiary referral center from April 2020 to March 2022, 363 (0.9%) patients with long COVID were evaluated by Cardiology for possible cardiac sequelae from COVID and formed the main study cohort. Of these, 229 (63%) were vaccinated and 47 (12.9%) had severe initial infection, receiving inpatient treatment for COVID prior to developing long COVID symptoms. Symptoms were associated with a cardiac cause in 85 (23.4%), of which 52 (14.3%) were attributed to COVID; 39 (10.7%) with new cardiac disease from COVID, and 13 (3.6%) to worsening of pre-existing cardiac disease after COVID infection. The median troponin change in 45 patients with troponin measurements within 4 weeks of acute infection was +4 ng/dL (9 to 13 ng/dL). Among the total cohort with long COVID, 83.7% were diagnosed during the pre-Delta phase, 13.2% during the Delta phase, and 3.1% during the Omicron phase of the pandemic. There were 6 cases of myocarditis, 11 rhythm disorders, 8 cases of pericarditis, 5 suspected cases of endothelial dysfunction, and 33 cases of autonomic dysfunction.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This pragmatic retrospective cohort study suggests that patients with long COVID referred for cardiovascular evaluation infrequently have new, objective cardiovascular disease to explain their clinical presentation. A multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach is warranted for symptom management along with conservative use of diagnostic testing.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Elsevier Inc.
