Therefore, this study examined well-being and cognitive function in people with long COVID (&#x223c;16 months illness duration; n = 17) and ME/CFS (&#x223c;16 years illness duration; n = 24), versus age-matched healthy controls (n = 16).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Well-being was examined using several questionnaires, namely the Health Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), post-exertional malaise (PEM), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), European Quality of Life-5 Domains (EQ-5D), MRC Dyspnoea, Self-Efficacy (SELTC), The Edinburgh Neurosymptoms Questionnaire (ENS), General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Cognitive function was examined using Single Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Stroop test and Trails A and B. These were delivered via a mobile application (app) built specifically for this remote data collection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The main findings of the present investigation were that people with ME/CFS and people with long COVID were generally comparable on all well-being and cognitive function measures, but self-reported worse values for pain, fatigue, post-exertional malaise, sleep quality, general well-being in relation to mobility, usual activities, self-care, breathlessness, neurological symptoms, self-efficacy and other well-being such as anxiety and depression, compared to controls. There was no effect of group for cognitive function measures.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">These data suggest that both people with long COVID and people with ME/CFS have similar impairment on well-being measures examined herein. Therefore, interventions that target well-being of people with ME/CFS and long COVID are required.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
