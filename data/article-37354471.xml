There is a significant difference observed during the acute phase as well as during the post-COVID period between patients hospitalized with (alpha, delta, or omicron) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant. In the present scenario, when most people are vaccinated, COVID-19 disease is less likely, but the remnants of previous COVID-19 infections are still a vast health burden.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This prospective, observational, comparative, and analytical study included a total of 3,840 COVID-19-infected patients who visited the hospital. We included 1,150 patients of alpha variants, 1,845 patients of delta variants, and 815 patients of omicron variants, from June 2020 to November 2020, March 2021 to July 2021, and January 2022 to May 2022, respectively. All medical data of the study population, including hospital stay and vaccination status, were collected, and all patients were followed up for 6 months of duration. All collected data were compiled and analyzed to compare the post-COVID thrombotic and other events among different variants of COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Patients infected during the delta variant are the most symptomatic at onset (higher prevalence of fever, dyspnea, cough, myalgia, headache, or gastrointestinal problems) than those infected with the alpha or omicron variant (p &amp;lt; 0.01). A total of 2,830 patients (7.48%) [1,520 (82.38%) of delta variant, 598 (73.37%) of omicron variant, and 712 (60.34%) of omicron variant] developed post-COVID syndrome during their follow-up period out of 3,220 enrolled patients and the difference was statistically significant when compared among variants (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In this study, the highly prevalent post-COVID syndrome was mucormycosis (11.41%), followed by new-onset diabetes (9.89%), pulmonary fiosis (7.67%), ischemic heart disease (6.46%), ain stroke (3.29%), and other thromboembolic disorders (2.37%).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">COVID-19-associated onset symptoms during the delta variant were more severe and highly prevalent, while neurological symptoms (aguesia and anosmia) were more common during the alpha variant. Patients infected with the delta variant of COVID-19 are more prone to develop post-COVID-associated complications with minimal risk in the omicron variant and intermediate risk in the alpha variant. Long COVID-19 requires specific attention for management, irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 variant.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Bhandari</LastName><ForeName>Sudhir</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Professor Emeritus, Sawai Man Singh Medical College and attached Hospitals; Vice Chancellor, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences;Corresponding Author.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rankawat</LastName><ForeName>Govind</ForeName><Initials>G</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Junior Specialist, Department of Medical &amp; Health, Government of India, Jaipur, Rajasthan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Joshi</LastName><ForeName>Shashank</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Endocrinologist, Lilavati Hospital &amp;amp; Research Centre.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tiwaskar</LastName><ForeName>Mangesh</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Consultant Physician &amp;amp; Diabetologist, Shilpa Medical Research Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lohmror</LastName><ForeName>Anurag</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Assistant Professor, Department of Geriatric Medicine, Sawai Man Singh Medical College and attached Hospitals, Jaipur, Rajasthan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Bhandari</LastName><ForeName>Shiven</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Intern, D.
