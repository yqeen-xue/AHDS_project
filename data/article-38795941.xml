Autonomic nervous system imbalance has been hypothesized as the cause. This study aims to investigate cardiovascular autonomic function in health care workers (HCWs) with Long COVID and the effectiveness of slow-paced breathing (SPB) on autonomic modulation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">From December 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023, 6655 HCWs of the University Hospitals of Trieste (Northeast Italy) were asked to participate in the study by company-email. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were assessed. Global health status and psychosomatic disorders were evaluated through validated questionnaires. Heart rate variability was assessed by finger-photoplethysmography during spontaneous breathing and SPB, which stimulate vagal response. Long COVID HCWs (G1) were contrasted with Never infected (G2) and Fully recovered COVID-19 workers (G3).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">There were 126 HCWs evaluated. The 58 Long COVID were assessed at a median time because COVID-19 of 419.5 days (interquartile range 269-730) and had significantly more psychosomatic symptoms and lower detectability of spontaneous systolic pressure oscillation at 0.1 Hz (Mayer wave - baroreflex arc) during spontaneous breathing compared with 53 never-infected and 14 fully-recovered HCWs (19%, 42%, and 40%, respectively, P = .027). During SPB, the increase in this parameter was close to controls (91.2%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, P = .09). No other differences in heart rate variability parameters were found among groups.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Resting vascular modulation was reduced in Long COVID, while during SPB, baroreflex sensitivity effectively improved. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate whether multiple sessions of breathing exercises can restore basal vascular reactivity and reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.
