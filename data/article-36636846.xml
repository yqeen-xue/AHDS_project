Although it was first defined by different names such as long COVID and post COVID in adults, it has been observed in studies that similar complaints such as cough, fatigue and difficulty in concentrating continue for a long time in children, just as in adults. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the status of long COVID in childhood. Our study included patients aged from one month to 18 years with moderate and severe symptoms who were hospitalized and discharged for SARS-CoV-2 infection in &#x130;stanbul University Faculty of Medicine between November 1, 2020 and November 1, 2021. A questionnaire form was created to learn about the complaints of the patients and their ongoing complaints. The patients/parents were called by phone and their complaints were recorded in the questionnaire. The patients were classified according to the definitions in the guidelines published by NICE, RCGP and SIGN. In total, 116 patients were included; 57.8% (n= 64) male, 42.5% (n= 49) female; 53.4% (n= 62) 0-9, 46.6% (n= 54) 10-18 years old. Comorbid conditions were found in 64 (55.2%) patients. The mean follow-up period was 5.90 &#xb1; 3.61 [min-max (1-12)] months; longest symptom durations: decrease in effort loss/fatigue 19.25 &#xb1; 74.56 (0-365) days, concentration difficulties 11.12 &#xb1; 49.75 (0-365) days, fatigue 9.61 &#xb1; 34.96 (0-365) days and cough were 8.34 &#xb1; 35.37 (0-365) days. The percentage of the patients who met the definition of subacute/ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 was 37.9% (n= 44). The most common symptoms were the decrease of effort capacity/fatigue 12.1% (n= 14) and the concentration difficulties 10.3% (n= 12) in subacute symptomatic patients. The percentage of patients matching the definition of chronic/post COVID-19 was 11.2% (n= 13). In the first year of the disease, ongoing complaints such as fatigue and concentration difficulties were observed in eight patients. The rate of concentration difficulties in the 10-18 age group was statistically significantly higher than the 0-9 age group (p= 0.037). In terms of other symptoms, no significant difference was found according to age, gender and concomitant disease status. Out of these, one patient was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus during the acute illness, and two patients were diagnosed with allergic rhinitis after COVID-19. A statistically significant difference was found in the rates of concentration disorders according to age groups with subacute/ongoing symptoms. Although only the hospitalized patients were included, fatigue and difficulty in concentration were among the most common ongoing symptoms in our study, similar to the literature, and they were seen to be more common in older children. It is important both for early diagnosis and awareness to follow up children with COVID-19 in terms of symptoms, not only in terms of prolonged symptoms but also in terms of new diseases.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Demirbu&#x11f;a</LastName><ForeName>Asuman</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>&#x130;stanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Health and Diseases, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, &#x130;stanbul, T&#xfc;rkiye.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Han&#xe7;erli T&#xf6;r&#xfc;n</LastName><ForeName>Selda</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>&#x130;stanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Health and Diseases, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, &#x130;stanbul, T&#xfc;rkiye.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kaba</LastName><ForeName>&#xd6;zge</ForeName><Initials>&#xd6;</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>&#x130;stanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Health and Diseases, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, &#x130;stanbul, T&#xfc;rkiye.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Dede</LastName><ForeName>Elif</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>&#x130;stanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Health and Diseases, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, &#x130;stanbul, T&#xfc;rkiye.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Mete Atasever</LastName><ForeName>Neslihan</ForeName><Initials>N</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>&#x130;stanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Health and Diseases, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, &#x130;stanbul, T&#xfc;rkiye.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ery&#x131;lmaz</LastName><ForeName>Cansu Ceren</ForeName><Initials>CC</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>&#x130;stanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Health and Diseases, &#x130;stanbul, T&#xfc;rkiye.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Okay</LastName><ForeName>Necla Simay</ForeName><Initials>NS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>&#x130;stanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Health and Diseases, &#x130;stanbul, T&#xfc;rkiye.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Somer</LastName><ForeName>Ayper</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>&#x130;stanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Health and Diseases, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, &#x130;stanbul, T&#xfc;rkiye.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>tur</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D004740">English Abstract</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><VernacularTitle>COVID-19 Nedeniyle Hastanede Yatan &#xc7;ocuk Hastalarda Uzun D&#xf6;nem Etkilerin ve Uzam&#x131;&#x15f;
