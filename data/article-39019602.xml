The Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), a measure of general fatigue, is useful for assessing fatigue in diverse cultures and diseases. However, there has been no study showing the reliability and validity of the scale in the Japanese context. The present study assessed the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the FAS. Methods This study was conducted on 649 patients with long COVID who had a high frequency of general fatigue. To test the structural validity of the FAS, the patients were randomly divided into two groups: one in which an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted and one in which a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to assess internal consistency reliability. Results As 58 patients had missing values, we analyzed the data of 591 patients. The EFA led to an FAS comprising two factors. The CFA showed an acceptable fit for this two-factor model. The internal consistency was found to be good (Cronbach's alpha =0.89). Conclusion This study verified the structural validity and internal consistency and reliability of the Japanese version of the FAS. The results indicate that the Japanese version of the FAS is useful for assessing general fatigue in patients with long COVID in Japan.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tokumasu</LastName><ForeName>Kazuki</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Japan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Matsuki</LastName><ForeName>Nobuyoshi</ForeName><Initials>N</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Epidemiology, Medical School, Okayama University, Japan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Fujikawa</LastName><ForeName>Hirohisa</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for General Medicine Education, School of Medicine, Keio University, Japan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medical Education Studies, International Research Center for Medical Education, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sakamoto</LastName><ForeName>Yoko</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Innovative Clinical Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Japan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Otsuka</LastName><ForeName>Fumio</ForeName><Initials>F</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Japan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>07</Month><Day>18</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>Japan</Country><MedlineTA>Intern Med</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9204241</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0918-2918</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS)</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">General fatigue</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Long COVID</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Post COVID-19 condition</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">ild care foundation (www.ildcare.nl)</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">&#x24b8;FAS (Fatigue Assessment Scale)</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>7</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>0</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>7</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>0</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>7</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>21</Hour><Minute>33</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39019602</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.2169/internalmedicine.4101-24</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
