The limited research available on the prevalence and experiences of post-COVID conditions among persons with HIV (PWH) indicates potential increased risk for post-COVID conditions. The purpose of this study was to characterize prevalence, symptom clustering, impact, and potential risk factors of post-COVID conditions among PWH. Data come from the COVID-19 survey, conducted as a sub-study of the DC Cohort Longitudinal HIV Study, an ongoing study of over 12,000 PWH living in Washington, DC. Survey data were matched to electronic medical record data. Prevalence estimates and multivariable logistic regression analyses were calculated comparing those with and without post-COVID conditions. The prevalence of post-COVID conditions among PWH was 46% with no significant differences among demographic or HIV measures. Those with history of asthma were more likely to report post-COVID conditions symptoms. Among those with post-COVID conditions, 81% reported three or more initial COVID symptoms. Retired/disabled PWH were more likely to report post-COVID conditions compared to employed (aOR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.37, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.06, 5.33). Post-COVID conditions significantly limited activities of daily living. Programs are needed to address the long-term impact of post-COVID conditions on activities of daily living among PWH.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Barth</LastName><ForeName>Shannon</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kulie</LastName><ForeName>Paige</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Monroe</LastName><ForeName>Anne</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Horberg</LastName><ForeName>Michael</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Mid-Atlantic Permanente Research Institute, Washington, DC, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Castel</LastName><ForeName>Amanda</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><CollectiveName>DC Cohort Executive Committee</CollectiveName><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><GrantList CompleteYN="Y"><Grant><GrantID>R24 AI152598</GrantID><Acronym>AI</Acronym><Agency>NIAID NIH HHS</Agency><Country>United States</Country></Grant></GrantList><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>06</Month><Day>11</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>AIDS Care</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8915313</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0954-0121</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">HIV</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Infectious diseases</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">SDG 3: Good health and well-being</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">long COVID</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">post COVID condition</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>18</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>18</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>14</Hour><Minute>32</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">38861652</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/09540121.2024.2357811</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
